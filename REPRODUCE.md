# Reproduce

One entry per driver, written when the driver's first run lands: the command
with its three arguments, the run ids it produced, the prover commit, the
digests, the binding table from the manifest, and the constants keys it backs.

Written, not yet run:

- `tools/drivers/headline-c16384.sh`: the paper's headline configuration, one
  16,384-token prompt and its 512 output tokens proved from the embedding up,
  on the CUDA backend, pipelined. Waits for the prover's sound defaults and
  provenance block.

## synthetic-digests

    tools/drivers/synthetic-digests.sh <host> <prover-commit> <harness-commit>

runs: 2026-09-07-synthetic-digests-h100
prover commit: e378539   harness commit: e378539
digests: first 16 hex, the same on both backends for each shape:
  `sound-simd.json`, `sound-cuda.json`: `82085896a8408f36`
  `sound_gkrfive-simd.json`, `sound_gkrfive-cuda.json`: `6bee5972d6f616aa`
  `sound_aligned-simd.json`, `sound_aligned-cuda.json`: `9c3cdebd97a7d57b`
binding (from the manifest, folded over the six proofs): unbound 3 and 5;
  1, 2, 4 and 6 to 14 bound; 15 and 16 absent
unsound skips: none
constants backed: none; a digest is a gate, not a number

What the run checks. A synthetic segment is a layer segment the prover makes
up: without a witness it draws the queries, keys, values, weights and the
residual-stream columns from a pseudorandom generator with a fixed seed, so
every machine builds the same segment, and nothing in it comes from a model or
from the harness. The proof over it is a real STARK with the same constraints,
the same binding gadgets and the same statement layout as a segment of that
shape taken from a model, and the verifier re-checks it from the serialized
bytes before the run reports `accepts`. The digest is SHA-256 over those proof
bytes and nothing else. A STARK proof is deterministic once the trace and the
parameters are fixed, so the SIMD backend and the CUDA backend must produce
byte-identical proofs: equal digests mean every committed column, every
constraint evaluation and every Merkle layer agreed on the device and on the
host. What a synthetic run leaves untested is only what a segment from a model
adds: the paper's shape (larger key tiles and tables, context 16,384), the
model commitment against the published root, and the extraction; that is what
the full-size reference run is for.

How the run is made. The harness commit is pinned and its source pushed, but
no harness step runs. The CUDA backend proves through device kernels generated
per segment shape, so the job emits the kernels for the three shapes into one
store, installs them into the vendored library and rebuilds; the built tree
then differs from the pushed commit, which is why the manifest records the
build as dirty. A `kernel fallback:` line on stderr would mean a lookup was
evaluated on the host instead of by its generated kernel; none appeared on any
of the three CUDA proofs, and the counts (0, 0 and 0) are in the `.fallbacks`
files beside the outputs.
